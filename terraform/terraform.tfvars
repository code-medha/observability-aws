# This file contains the default values for the AWS region and profile used in the Terraform configuration.
# You can override these values by providing your own in a separate tfvars file or through the command line.
# Example usage:
# terraform apply -var="aws_region=us-west-2" -var="aws_profile=my-profile"
# This will deploy resources to the us-west-2 region using the 'my-profile' AWS CLI profile.
# Ensure that the AWS CLI is configured with the specified profile before running Terraform commands.
